# fix-all-the-things!

Making the world better through software.

Come with us now on a journey through time and space to concieve of ideas that are so crazy they might actually work.

Think some thoughts, invent your own ideas, and comment on existing ones.

## Idea bank

[Go to the issues to get started](https://github.com/willsheppard/fix-all-the-things/issues).

Feel free to implement any of the ideas without restriction, I ask only that you post a comment here informing everyone where they can download your software.
The whole point of this is for software to actually get shipped to the public.
