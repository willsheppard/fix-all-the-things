# fix-all-the-things! Idea bank

Making the world better through software.

Come with us now on a journey through time and space to concieve of ideas that are so crazy they might actually work.

Think some thoughts, invent your own ideas, and comment on existing ones.

[Go to the issues to get started](https://github.com/willsheppard/fix-all-the-things/issues).

Feel free to implement any of the ideas, I ask only that you post a comment here informing us all of your hard work.
The main point of this all is for things to actually get done.
